General Description:
A rectangular patio is attached to a house. We want to find the length of strings of party lights needed to hang on the three sides of the patio not attached to the house plus from corner to corner in a X pattern.

Write a C++ program that gets the length of side of the patio opposite the house and the length of one of the sides of the patio perpendicular to the house from the user and calculates the length of the runs to be strung. You will need to add a 7% sag to each of the (5) runs so that the lights are not taut. Display: the total length of the runs before the sag is added, the length of the side opposite run including sag, the length of the two perpendicular runs including sag, the length of the two diagonal runs including sag, and finally the total length of the party lights needed including sag.

Be sure you ask the user to enter each of the lengths in feet.

All variables and constants used should be of type double.

Sample results when length of side opposite house is 16.75 and length of side perpendicular to house is 12:
```
Total length calculated = 81.9598 feet.
The length of the run opposite the house including sag = 17.9225 feet.
The length of the two perpendicular runs including sag = 12.84 feet each.
The length of the two diagonal runs including sag = 22.0473 feet each.
The total length of the strands needed including sag = 87.697 feet.
